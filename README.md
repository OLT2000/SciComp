This differential equation toolkit can be used to numerically integrate ordinary differential equations; track limit cycle oscillations in differential equations; numerically continue parameters and track equilibria or limit cycles and approximate solutions to partial differential equations of varying boundary condition types.


## Requirements
- NumPy
- SciPy
- MatPlotLib

## Examples
>Examples of the code can be found in the examples file within the github, each of which contains plotting functions and error comparison against true solutions.
